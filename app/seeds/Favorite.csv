26,1,This is such a great fragrance. I love the ginger that just pops with this scent. I picked it up on Scenthood for Black Friday/cyber Monday. This stuff on my skin doesn’t stop! I originally sampled it from a drug store on my hand and it lasted well into the next day. That’s pretty awesome I scrubbed my hands multiple times during that time. For the price I paid I think this is amazing.
25,1,"This is a great winter and fall fragrance. It opens with vanilla, then ginger, then finally wood. I wear it almost every day. Performance is really good on it, and it has a good longevity, I would say 7 hours. Everyone should try out this masterpiece!"
24,1,"This is addictive, really good. It feels elegant due to the woody notes, but also very sexy because of the vanilla sweetness – stellar combination."
10,2,"Smooth expensive black french leather, dry, not sweet, stark and dark, classy, and clean. I don't get the amber aspect as it's too dry and stark to be ambery (sweet and cozy). Great for fall and winter nights. Black tie events, maybe office if restrained with the sprays. Very nice."
